## Using the app  
On the initial page load data is requested from the Ticketmaster API for the next 7 days for the Northern England region. Filter labels (location, date) are created from the fetched data.  
The events are displayed in a list in the side menu, where they can be filtered for multiple locations and days plus searched by event name in the search field. Searching / filtering updates the event list and shows only those on the map.  
On the map venues are displayed, clicking on the marker shows all the events for that venue in the infowindow.  
Hovering on events in the side menu highlights the relevent venue marker on the map, clicking on the event list item centers the map and displays an infowindow with additional details above the venu marker along with a link to Ticketmaster website and an image.
